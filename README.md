# Moose Clothing

This is an e-commerce project that is entirely front-end oriented. 
Written in the following technologies:
- **React**: visual part and rendering of the page.
- **Hooks**: this project is an update of my other one (https://github.com/xNoxious/e-clothing). Whilst the first one uses class components, I decided to focus this one heavily on functional components and utilizing the hooks features of React. My former project also has an integration with the **Stripe** API for payments. Have a look if you are interested. 
- **React Router**: routing of the site's sub-pages.
- **Redux**: state management of cart items and user authentication.
- **Redux Persist**: persisting and re-hydrating the cart in the store when a user leaves and returns to the page.
- **Redux Thunk**: dispatching my external asynchronous API calls to get the necessary data like: user's profile from Firestore or products data.
- **Reselect**: memoizing some of the components' loading like the cart and the shop categories menus. 
- **Firebase**: user authentication via Google or username/password based authentication.
- **Netlify**: deploying the application
